nificance of this observation is obscure.
FACTORS INITIATING APOPTOSIS
Little is known of the factors that
initiate apoptosis or of the nature of the
cellular mechanisms activated before the
appearance of the characteristic mor-
phological changes. It seems clear, how-
ever, that in certain circumstances apop-
tosis is an inherently programmed event,
determined by intrinsic " clocks " specific
for the cell type involved. Thus in avian
embryonic tissue explants apoptosis oc-
curred in susceptible zones " on schedule "
